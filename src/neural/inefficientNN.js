// lets make a nn that calculates the adjustment to every weight and bias that is the most efficient ...
// that is direction and size
// also we kinda need to average this over all the possible inputs ...
// sounds terifying in some ways

// rather than the above - which is nice and all but takes waay too long
// why not try a different approach ?
// we simply need to design the system in reverse so that the desired outputs 
// are achieved by the correct inputs right ?
// can't we apply some modularity to this ?
