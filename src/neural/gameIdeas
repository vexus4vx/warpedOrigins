1: I love the idea of a raid type game 
2: I however dislike its rigidity

if we supply each unit with unique stats and have some kinda large degree of variance
then we can basically achieve a stat distribution that is similar to the normal, epic, ..., legendary 
distribution 



game rules and gameplay


1: summon units - say 1 per day and start off with 10
2: fight against enemies of various set classes / races - ie monsters and or units 
3: all dead units remain dead 
4: various combat weapons and magics are available to use


unit 
- physical traits - (hair, colour, limb length, ...)
- stats - [
    level,
    talent (learning) - [fixed] how many abilities can be learned,
    growth, - [fixed] stat multiplier => strength(lv2) = strength(base) * (growth + level), ...
    strength,
    agility,
    reflex,
    stamina,
    health,
    intelegance,
    skill, - [fixuser-setable] the skill's this unit posesses
    ai - [fixed] a custom neural network for this unit (
        the inputs are as follows
        1: the units senses input node count based on the units base reflex and agility stat
        2: the units confidence input node count based on base stamina and strength stats
        3: comunication - fixed size + int stat, so the ai can deal with the max number of freindly units
        4: task - fixed size + int stat - the unit needs to understand its role - including its capabilities
        - the intent here is to allow the unit to grow so that it can be overcome the stat deficiancies by creatively using it's skills
        - the output of this network determines the choices made in moving, using skills and most importantly working with allies
    )
]
- weapon slots - (one 2 handed or 2 single handed)
- armour slot - (armours will have weight and bulkieness that slow down units along with defence)
- status effects - ... (whatever - poisoned, pregnant, ...)
