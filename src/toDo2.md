we should take the ai generated images and craft an 8bit immage mask for them 
this way we can allow certain areas to be connected and also changed
say the face is made up of groups 0 - 5 then we could shift their shades by n and vola we get a similar yet different character
this way we can transfer hair and skin color from image to image allowing us to make a neater game 
with children resembling their parents

thats all nice and well but still isn't relevant for the 3d game - just the 2d one

Thus : I need to write a function that aids me in image manipulation 
1: edge detection 
2: allow user to select areas and assign numbers ?
3: create a numerical pixel map that tells me what parts of the image may change together
    so if skin is from 0 to 10 and hair is from 90 to 100 and clothes are from 170 to 200 and immutable background stuff is from 210 to 255 then we can target areas in which the color is to be changed



---- unit tradeing
1: need account
2: server needs to log a units existance and who had it originally and who it was sold to
3: transactions with the same unit multiple times need to be penalised - say you take 100% - ?cent of the price ... || 99%
-- something like that
