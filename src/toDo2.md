we should take the ai generated images and craft an 8bit immage mask for them 
this way we can allow certain areas to be connected and also changed
say the face is made up of groups 0 - 5 then we could shift their shades by n and vola we get a similar yet different character
this way we can transfer hair and skin color from image to image allowing us to make a neater game 
with children resembling their parents

thats all nice and well but still isn't relevant for the 3d game - just the 2d one
