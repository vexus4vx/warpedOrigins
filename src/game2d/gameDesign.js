// saveing - we should create an object and save it to a json file - this way we simply need to load it into existance
const LoadGame = () => {
    // required

}


/*
    initially I want the following
    1: an explanation of the game
    2: Load, settings, exit and new Game options - this should be kinda in your face

        3: New Game
            1: carackter creation 
                this is not limited to playable charackters visual appearance
                it could be something like choosing a race or bonuses you want to play with
                this should have a default or random option for lazy people who will inevitably be screwed by their lack of patience at this point
            2: gameplay
                we need a clear description of objectives along with an introduction to the various options
            3: auxilary
                we need some auxilary mechanisms that speed up and allign processes
